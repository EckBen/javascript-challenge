## UFO Sightings Dashboard

This challenge was to create a web dashboard using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to display
data regarding UFO sightings. Using Javascript, I created a script to dynamically create a table to display the entire dataset.
As an added challenge I created a menu to filter the data displayed based on date, location, and shape of UFO.
